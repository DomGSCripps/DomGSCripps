      <h3>Undergraduate Dissertation - A Comparative Analysis of Two-Dimensional Run Length Encoding for Image Compression</h3>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 2024</p>
      <p>This project received a First. This project creates an application that exploits two-dimensional spatial redundancy through the use of a new 2D Run Length Encoding (2D RLE) algorithm in conjunction with existing encoding methods, such as Deflate, Huffman Coding, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transformation. The proposed 2D RLE algorithm when followed with Deflate compression consistently performed better than PNG for low entropy images and similarly to PNG for high entropy images.</p>
